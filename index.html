    <h1>Offline First <span class="deemphasize">Development</span></h1>

    <p>Internet access is not a universal constant. When we build apps as
    though it were, we open the door to a wide variety of problems.  How can we
    become more aware of these problems and design our apps accordingly?</p>

    <p><a href="#">Offline First App Development</a> is a book about robust
    apps. Apps which don&rsquo;t curl up and die when you pull the plug. Apps
    which are just as comfortable online as they are offline. Apps which Just
    Work&trade;.</p>
    
    <h2>Why this book?</h2>

    <p>I assume you already know how to build mobile apps. That&rsquo;s not the
    point of this book.  The point of this book is to show how you can start
    with a 100% offline app (a position of strength and resiliency) and extend
    it to embrace the power of being online. You will use the following tools
    and services to achieve this:

    <ul>
      <li>PouchDB</li>
      <li>Cloudant</li>
      <li>Sencha Touch</li>
      <li>Cordova</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Offline first</h2>

    <p>Humans are optimists by nature. We tend to design and build the happy
    path first. Only then are the errors and worst case scenarios considered,
    often resulting in a major refactor or rewrite. An offline first approach
    is only one of many choices.  You can design for security first, mobile
    first, accessibility first, or performance first, as well.</p>

    <p>With all of those options, why choose offline first? Being offline is a
    situation that almost all of us experience on a regular basis. When it
    happens, it&rsquo;s annoying and frustrating, sometimes in a big way. In
    short, it&rsquo;s a fantastic area to begin to explore the world of robust
    apps. Let&rsquo;s delve into some of the things you&rsquo;ll learn.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Learn how to use common libraries to enhance the offline experience of
      mobile apps.</li>
      <li>Understand the design principles behind a well-designed offline
      experience.</li>
      <li>Learn how to design empty states and errors that inform, not confuse.
      </li>
      <li>Learn how to create the illusion of being online when youâ€™re really
      offline.</li>
      <li>Learn how to build user trust by being transparent and setting good
      expectations.</li>
      <li>Learn how to make an application adjust gracefully to changing network
      conditions.</li>
      <li>Understand the problem of split-brain, and how to minimize its effects
      while offline.</li>
      <li>Learn how to pick an appropriate caching strategy based on your user
      scenarios.</li>
      <li>Learn about the current state of peer-to-peer networking on mobile
      devices.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>You might assume that this is a problem that only a few apps have.
    Unfortunately, this is not the case. Put your phone in airplane mode and
    open Pinterest or Apple Maps. These are popular apps with terrible offline
    experiences. Data is not cached, error messages are ambiguous, and
    inconsistencies abound.</p>

    <h2>Design and application</h2>
    
    <p>This book is design focused. You must care about the people for which
    you are crafting an experience. Once you have empathy, only then can you
    focus on the right problems to solve.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike typical design books, which inspire but don&rsquo;t follow through
    with application, this book does both. You will write an app which applies
    what you learn about offline design. Or apply the lessons to your own
    applications immediately. Your choice.</p>

    <p>As you think about offline first development, a useful analogy is the
    bunker and the beach house. An offline app is like a hardened bunker,
    functional but isolated. An online app is like a beach house, open but
    vulnerable. You can combine these two approaches while retaining the
    strengths of each.</p>

    <p>The problem is that most developers build the beach house first. Often,
    retrofitting a bunker is not simple. You end up building a bunker, then
    rebuilding the beach house on top of it. Our strategy is the opposite.</p>

    <p>You start by building a fully-functional, but offline version of a todo
    app. Each chapter, I&rsquo;ll introduce a new concept which gradually turns
    the app into a first-class online citizen. Because you started with a
    robust starting point, it&rsquo;s much easier to ensure that you retain
    that solid foundation.</p>

    <h2>Measuring the experience</h2>

    <p>This raises an interesting question. How do you measure robustness?
    There isn&rsquo;t a single metric to answer this question. Instead,
    We&rsquo;ll use a set of 10 principles of good offline design. You&rsquo;ll
    measure the app against these at regular intervals to get a sense of the
    robustness of your app. The principles are as follows:

    <ol>
      <li>Content is mutable. Don&rsquo;t let my online/offline status change that.
      </li>
      <li>Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried.
      </li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t let me start something I can&rsquo;t finish.</li>
      <li>An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest
      about it.</li>
      <li>When laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when
      caching.</li>
      <li>Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.</li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.</li>
      <li>Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don&rsquo;t be jarring.</li>
      <li>Never purge the cache unless I demand it.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
