    <h1>Refining <span class="deemphasize">Details</span></h1>

    <p>A natural inclination of designers is to make things look
    &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;. This is not a bad urge. The problem is when we spend
    time refining a solution which is fundamentally wrong. When you browse
    Dribbble, you notice lots of lovely things, but they are often missing a
    purpose or failing to meet a need.</p>

    <p>However, when you finally build something worthwhile, you&rsquo;ll want
    to turn it from an ugly duckling into a swan. And that&rsquo;s the right
    order of things.</p>

    <p>In late 2014, I joined Sonatype as a UX developer. They were in the
    middle of the next major version of Nexus, a repository management tool for
    developers. Nexus is a tool used by tens of thousands of people. It is a
    fantastic tool that is fundamental to how development is done. When I
    started, it looked something like this:</p>

    <img src="nexus_m2.png" alt="Nexus 3 Milestone 2"/>
    <figure>Nexus 3 Milestone 2</figure>

    <p>This is a perfect example of valuable tool, ugly duckling. As a designer
    and front-end developer, this was a perfect opportunity to give Nexus a
    visual makeover and make it easier to use at the same time.</p>

    <h2>Styling improvements</h2>

    <p>By the time Nexus 3 was released, it looked like this:</p>

    <img src="nexus_m5.png" alt="Nexus 3 GA"/>

    <p>To get it to this point, I made a number of refinements. First, I
    shifted the colors to draw the eye to the most relevant part of the
    interface. White is a bright color, and I reserved it for the header and
    content area of the selected feature. Other areas of the interface received
    darker shades of grey to deemphasize them.</p>

    <p>Next, I removed the border underneath the feature icon and title to
    reflect the way the tool scrolls. In a typical grid view, the icon, title,
    action buttons, and filter input are fixed to the top. The grid scrolls. To
    make this relationship clearer, I gave the aforementioned elements a shared
    white background.</p>

    <p>The header received the next batch of changes. The active mode is
    indicated by a blue background. Because the active mode is such an
    important visual clue for orientation, I made it full bleed in the header.
    I also tied it to the rest of the page by adding a caret.</p>

    <p>In addition, I revised the header icons from grey to white. This boosted
    contrast and gave the modes more pop. Finally, I aligned the version number
    with the baseline of the header title to make the overall effect more
    cohesive.</p>

    <p>With respect to the content area itself, you might notice that M2 had
    significantly more buttons above the grid. All of these buttons, save one,
    require that a grid row be selected first. To simplify the UI and make this
    relationship clearer, I removed the buttons from this view and added them
    to the detail panel that appears when a row is selected.</p>

    <p>Typography played another key role in the improvements. First, we
    updated the font itself to Proxima Nova, used in our other products. Then,
    we boosted the size of the feature title to help orient people.</p>

    <p>The last thing you might notice is the right-hand carets, one per row in
    the grid. These were added as an affordance to hint at the result of
    clicking a row in the grid. I&rsquo;ll describe this drilldown interaction
    more thoroughly in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Replace modals with drilldown</h2>

    <p>Modals are often a case of lazy design. A common scenario is when you want to enforce a linear workflow. In M2, we used them extensively. One of my goals was to replace modals with a better-designed alternative.</p>

    <p>The alternative I chose is something I call &ldquo;drilldown&rdquo;.
    Instead of a modal, when you make a selection, the panel slides to the left
    and your selection slides in from the right. It includes a breadcrumb, so
    you can easily navigate back, and supports multiple levels of drilldown.
    This is handy when designing a wizard that consists of multiple steps.</p>
